## Problem Statement
Home Automation
a. Use TinkerCAD platform to automate two basic things in your home so
that they can be done according to the room’s environment.
b. The first thing to be automated is the ceiling or table fan which should
turn on according to the room’s temperature. If the room’s
temperature goes above 40 degrees Celsius, the fan should turn on. If
the temperature falls below 35 degrees Celsius, the fan should turn on..
c. The second thing to be automated is the lighting in the room. If the
room’s light intensity is minimum, light should turn on. If the room’s
light intensity is maximum, light should turn on..
d. Bonus: Setting up a channel in cloud platforms like Thing Speak, Blynk,
Azure for showing the status of fan and light. (Use wowki platform if
you are connecting to Cloud).
